proxy.{c,h}	- Primary proxy code
csapp.{c,h}	- Wrapper and helper functions from the CS:APP text


Compile the code using: "make"
Run the code using: "./proxy {port #}"

Writing Program Descriptions Here:

I did not add any of my own helper functions because I did not find myself repeating
any chunks of code. My code creates and binds a socket based on the inputted port and any
addresses available via INADDR_ANY. It then loops while accepting incoming connections to the socket.
It reads in any request sent to the socket. From the request, it resolves the host name and a port
if a port is found. It opens a connection to the the webserver using the host and port, or port 80
if none is given. Then, it reads the request sent by the browser into the open connection it has
with the webserver. Next, it reads what the webserver's response is and writes that back to the
client socket. Lastly, it opens the log file to write in a description of the request. I included some
comments describing different parts of the code to replace what would otherwise be helper function descriptions.
